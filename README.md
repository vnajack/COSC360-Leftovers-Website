# Leftovers Club Website
Final Project due 9 April 2020

Authors: Veronica Jack and Katrina Martel

## General Information
Veronica and Katrina's course project for COSC 360: Web Programming is a website for UBC Okanagan's Leftovers Club.

This project was created using PHP, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript with an SQL backbone.

Please view our [walkthrough](https://youtu.be/9bHVottVUas) and [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GmA4fKqVMlx_RJVaoVy-HaLnCF7eD9V_/view?usp=sharing) to learn more.

## Setup
Before testing our website, please follow these steps (assuming you have XAMPP installed and running):

1) Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and create a new database called 'leftovers_db'

2) On the top navigation bar of phpmyadmin, select Import

3) When asked to Choose File, select the 'leftovers_db.sql' file we provided. Importing may take a minute, but the tables will all be imported for you.

4) Move the 'LeftoversClub' folder into your C:/xampp/htdocs directory

5) In your browser, go to localhost/LeftoversClub/ to view our website

Thank you!
